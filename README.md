# Errors

runtime errors happen after creation phase/parsing
* they will appear under the log --- broken code ---
syntax errors will keep JS from parsing your code
* they will appear all alone since the logs never happened


learning objectives:
* reading & identifying error messages
* finding and fixing errors
* runtime vs syntax errors 
* building a personal error+fix reference
* not logic errors, that's for 'debugging'
* using replit

## The Challenges

(to be done in replit)
a whole bunch.   take a look through them and see which are best or which you've come across yourself   
we can refine this in meetups by seeing what errors people often make

```js
var = 5;

let a = {b:3};
a.b.3

let a = {b:'e'};
b.e

let a;
a.b;

let a = 'this is 
two lines';

let a = 1:

let myArray = [1, 2, 3;

function getNine {
  let x = 6;
  let y = 3;
  return x + y;
}
let result = getNine;

let innerHtml = "<p>Click here to <a href="#Home">return home</a></p>";

let nested_messages = 'remind yourself ''i can do this!'' at least once a day';

const a = 9;
a = 0;

const a;
a = 0;

let value = 0;
while (value < 9) 
  value++;
};

let array = [];
array.length()
```

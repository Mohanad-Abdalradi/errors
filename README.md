# errors

we will give them several snippets of code that throw errors, they will paste them into the first section of the template and complete the rest

learning objectives:
* reading & identifying error messages
* finding and fixing errors
* runtime vs syntax errors 
* building a personal error+fix reference
* not logic errors, that's for 'debugging'
